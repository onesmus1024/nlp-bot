This is telling the compiler that the variable 'myVariable' is of type 'string'.On the other hand, Type inference is a feature where the compiler assigns the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. For example: let myVariable = 'hello', in this case the compiler knows that the variable 'myVariable' is of type 'string' because a string value is assigned to it.Type inference is a powerful feature of TypeScript that allows developers to write code more quickly and with fewer errors, but sometimes it's not enough and you might need to use type annotation for better type checking and catch errors early."

Tuples are an array with a fixed-length array and they specify the types they are supposed to hold, how many values they are supposed to hold, and the order of the values. Enums are closely related to tuples, they are used to describe a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Union types help us to hold values that are either a string or a number in an array. Literal types uses union types to ensure that a value holds one of the defined types.

The main difference between unknown and any is that unknown is a more restrictive type and it requires explicit type checking before the value can be used, while any can be used without type checking.The any type is useful when you are working with third-party libraries and you don't have the type information. The unknown type is useful when you don't know the type at the time of writing the code but you know it will be known at runtime.In general, it's recommended to avoid using any and unknown types as much as possible, and instead, use more specific types to ensure type safety and catch errors early."

This function is an example of a never type because it does not return a value or anything, only crashes the application.The never type can also be used to indicate that a variable or a function parameter will never have a certain value.
